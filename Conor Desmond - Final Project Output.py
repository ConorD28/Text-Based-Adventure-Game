A person named Joe wakes up inside a strange building. Joe does not recall how he got inside the building. The last thing he remembers doing was studying
geography, state capitals, and programming. He sees a door ahead of him and walks up to it. He tries to open the door, but it is locked. Joe is required to go 
through 4 doors to get out of the building. He is required to answer 3 questions about state capitals to unlock the first door, answer 3 programming questions
to unlock the second door, fill in 3 blanks with the correct numbers to unlock the third door, and answer 3 geography questions with the correct answers to unlock
the fourth and final door. He sees a touchscreen next to the door. The touchscreen states, 'The user of this touchscreen and other touchscreens in this building gets
2 attempts per question. The user gets 1 point per correct answer, and if the user has at least 1 point, a loss of a point per incorrect answer. If the user of this
device gets a question wrong twice, this door will never unlock. But, if the user gets all three questions right, a button will come up, that if pressed, will unlock
this door. Push the enter button to begin playing Joe’s Journey.
